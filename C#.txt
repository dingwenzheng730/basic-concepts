1. What is delegate?
It is a type-safe pointer to a function 

delegate void Function1(String s);

It means a function called Function1 with String input and void return

2. How to write EventsHandler?
i) Define eventsargs class and the args property

public class ThresholdReachedEventArgs : EventArgs {
	public int Threshold { get; set; }
    public DateTime TimeReached { get; set; }
}

ii) For the class triggerring the event, define event handle 

public event EventHandler<ThresholdReachedEventArgs> ThresholdReached;

iii) For the class triggerring the event, define "On" function(trigger function)
protected virtual void OnThresholdReached(ThresholdReachedEventArgs e)
{
    ThresholdReachedEventHandler handler = ThresholdReached;
    if (handler != null)
    {
        handler(this, e);
    }        
}

iv) For the class receiving the event, define handler function 

static void c_ThresholdReached(Object sender, ThresholdReachedEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The threshold of {0} was reached at {1}.", e.Threshold, e.TimeReached);
    Environment.Exit(0);
}

v) Append the handler function to the event handler
c.ThresholdReached += c_ThresholdReached;

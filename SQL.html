Inner join focus on commonalitiy of two tables. Never produces NULL.<br/>
<br/>
Outter join may produce NULL. <br/>
<br/>
Inner only outpus entries that show in both table. <br/>
Outter(left, right, full)<br/>
Left/righ: output all entires in right table.<br/>
Full: output all entries in both table(Take union operation)<br/>
